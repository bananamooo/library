{app_name} began as a quiet act of creation — an effort to find clarity, healing, and direction through building. Drawing on a background in ontologies and large language models, the project took shape as a way to craft something both technically interesting and personally meaningful. The Human Resource domain was chosen for its relatability — practical, universal, and deeply human in nature.

More than just an application, {app_name} represents the belief that making something — however small — can be a way forward. Every feature, every decision, reflects care and intent, shaped not only by technical choices but by a desire to connect, to learn, and to share.
