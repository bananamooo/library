${app_name} began in the aftermath of a series of unfortunate events that disrupted the creator’s professional path. Rather than remain defined by that chapter, the project was born as a way to rebuild — using existing knowledge in ontologies and large language models to craft something of personal and technical value. The HR domain was chosen not for complexity, but for its human relatability.

${app_name} represents more than just an app — it symbolizes a personal reckoning. It's a project born out of the desire to rise from the ashes, to turn adversity into something that can help build a path to future success.
