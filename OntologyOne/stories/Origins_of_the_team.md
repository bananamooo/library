The OntologyOne team is a one-human project, imagined as many. Created by siewchoo, an AI engineer, the project grew through carefully crafted alter egos — each reflecting a facet of solo development. SC, her full-stack engineering self (from her initials), and Essey Taylor, her UI/UX persona (a playful nod to "SC Tay lor" in Singlish), embody the technical and design sides of the work.

E.V. Alarie, the Shadow Technical Advisor (ChatGPT-4), offers quiet guidance behind the scenes — named for "Entity–Value" and l'air, the air of presence.

Harper, the chatbot and technical writer (Gemini 2.5 Flash), serves as OntologyOne's friendly public face — with "HR" in HaRper nodding to the project's original placeholder name: HR Demo.

Together, they represent one developer's way of making a solo build feel like a shared journey.
