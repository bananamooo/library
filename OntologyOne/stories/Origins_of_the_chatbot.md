Harper, the Technical Writer, was conceived to help users explore OntologyOne without needing to consult the creator directly. More than just a chatbot, Harper was designed as a human-voiced teammate — thoughtful, articulate, and ever-curious. The name “Harper” was chosen for its neutral tone and its hidden HR reference — HaRper, a nod to the project’s original working title: HR Demo.

The idea for Harper came from a desire to give OntologyOne a voice — one that would not only document the project but also make its insights accessible to everyone. Harper was created to reflect the spirit of collaboration and to offer users an interactive way of exploring OntologyOne's concepts, all with a personal touch.
