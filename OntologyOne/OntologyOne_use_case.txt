GlobalTech - A Use Case
=======================
GlobalTech is an IT consultancy With operations in regions like Singapore, China, Germany, and the USA, each maintaining its own HR systems and data structures. As it faces  rapid growth, GlobalTech needed a unified solution to harmonize critical information relating to its human resources. 


OntologyOne - The Solution
==========================
OntologyOne is a vision prototype developed to explore how ontologies and large language models (LLMs) can be used to integrate heterogeneous Human Resource (HR) data across international offices. The project is based on a fictitious company, GlobalTech, which represents a typical fast-growing IT consultancy facing real-world data harmonization challenges.

In our imagined use case, each regional office maintains its own HR data model, resulting in fragmented and inconsistent employee data. As a cloud-based app, OntologyOne uses  OWL ontologies authored in RDF/XML format and large language models to support ubiquitous access to semantic integration of multilingual, region-specific HR data by GlobalTech's HR department.

To this end, OntologyOne leverages ontologies to create a shared semantic framework that models employee-related concepts (e.g., roles, departments, office locations) across all regions. The ontology backbone consists of 4 local office RDF ontologies (i.e. China, Germany, Singapore and the United States) and 1 ontology that unifies these local office ontologies.
