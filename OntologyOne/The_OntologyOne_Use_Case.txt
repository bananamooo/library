OntologyOne is a cloud-based ontology-powered solution developed to address the challenge of harmonizing fragmented human resource (HR) data across GlobalTech’s international offices. It is designed as a prototype to explore how ontologies and large language models (LLMs) can be combined to achieve semantic integration of diverse, multilingual HR data. It was built over 4 months by the dev team.

GlobalTech is a fast-growing IT consultancy operating in multiple regions, including Singapore, China, Germany, and the USA. Each regional office maintains its own HR system and schema, resulting in data silos and inconsistent representations of employees, departments, roles, and benefits.

OntologyOne solves this problem by creating a unified semantic layer — a global ontology framework that integrates these regional differences into a cohesive, machine-interpretable knowledge graph. At its core is a Unified Ontology, which acts as the central backbone that aligns and connects four regional RDF/XML ontologies. These ontologies represent the local HR models for each office and are formally linked through shared concepts defined in the unified layer.

By using OWL ontologies and LLM-based natural language interfaces, OntologyOne enables HR professionals at GlobalTech to:
- Query complex HR relationships across regions
- Access consistent, semantically enriched employee data
- Bridge cross-border schema differences using shared ontology logic

In short, OntologyOne is about semantic integration, ontology-based reasoning, and cross-regional data harmonization — providing a powerful foundation for globally consistent HR insights.
